# eCommerce Transactions Analysis  

This repository contains the analysis and solutions for the **eCommerce Transactions Dataset** assignment. It covers three key tasks: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), Lookalike Model development, and Customer Segmentation.  

## Repository Structure  
The repository is organized as follows:  

### Files:  
1. **EDA**:  
   - `Mohammad_Aamir_EDA.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook for exploratory data analysis.  
   - `Mohammad_Aamir_EDA.pdf`: PDF report summarizing the EDA results and business insights.  

2. **Lookalike Model**:  
   - `Mohammad_Aamir_Lookalike.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook for building the lookalike model.  
   - `Mohammad_Aamir_Lookalike.csv`: CSV file containing the top 3 lookalike customers and similarity scores for the first 20 customers.  

3. **Customer Segmentation (Clustering)**:  
   - `Mohammad_Aamir_Clustering.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook for customer segmentation using clustering techniques.  
   - `Mohammad_Aamir_Clustering.pdf`: PDF report summarizing clustering results, metrics, and visualizations.  

## Dataset  
The assignment uses three files:  
- **Customers.csv**: Contains customer profile information.  
- **Products.csv**: Contains product details.  
- **Transactions.csv**: Contains transaction data.  

### Note:  
The dataset files are not included in this repository. Download them from the following links:  
- [Customers.csv](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1bu_--mo79VdUG9oin4ybfFGRUSXAe-WE/view?usp=sharing)  
- [Products.csv](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1IKuDizVapw-hyktwfpoAoaGtHtTNHfd0/view?usp=sharing)  
- [Transactions.csv](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1saEqdbBB-vuk2hxoAf4TzDEsykdKlzbF/view?usp=sharing)  

## Tasks  

### 1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
- Conducted EDA to understand the dataset and derive actionable business insights.  
- Key visualizations: Sales trends, top products, regional distribution, etc.  
- Deliverables: `EDA.ipynb` and `EDA.pdf`.  

### 2. **Lookalike Model**  
- Developed a model to recommend 3 similar customers based on their profile and transaction history.  
- Used similarity measures to calculate scores.  
- Deliverables: `Lookalike.ipynb` and `Lookalike.csv`.  

### 3. **Customer Segmentation (Clustering)**  
- Performed customer segmentation using clustering algorithms.  
- Evaluated clustering performance using DB Index.  
- Visualized clusters for better interpretation.  
- Deliverables: `Clustering.ipynb` and `Clustering.pdf`.
